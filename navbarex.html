        <p>For many parents, it would be much easier and simpler to forget about family dinners. Jobs, children, after-school activities all contribute to families being constantly 
            on the go, thus feeling the need to eat on the run..</p>
        <p>Dinnertime is a time of respite from the hustle-bustle of everyday life. Your family can review the day that's passed and plan for the day that's coming.</p>
        <h5>Expectations</h5>
        <p>The purpose of a family dinner may differ from family to family. In one family, good table manners might be the most important thing parents want to teach; in another, 
            it might be communicating with one another, learning how to listen, and learning to respect each other.

            Children need to learn a little bit at a time, experts say. If dinnertime is an interesting time of day for your child, 
            he is going to learn how to sit, and say, "How was your day?" and "What was the best thing that happened to you.</p>

        <h5>Seating</h5>
        <p>Parents should let children choose their own seats. If they fight over a favorite seat, help settle the dispute peacefully.</p>
        <h5>Family dynamics</h5>

        <p>One parent may feed the kids early, with the intention of protecting the other parent from a raucous meal. But this actually can isolate the absent parent from family dynamics and create distance. Certain scheduling conflicts cannot be avoided, but carving out family meal time on a regular basis can enhance family dynamics. </p>
